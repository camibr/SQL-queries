/*
Using the database WideWorldImporters, write a SQL query which reports the consistency between orders and their attached invoices.

-- STRATEGY -> PIVOTING


SELECT 
	*, ABS(OrdersTotalValue - InvoicesTotalValue) AS AbsoluteValueDifference
	
FROM 
	(
		SELECT cu.CustomerID
		, cu.CustomerName
	
		,	(
				SELECT COUNT(*)
				FROM Sales.Orders as od
				WHERE cu.CustomerID = od.CustomerID
			) AS TotalNBOrders
	
		,	(
				SELECT	COUNT(*)

		,	(
				SELECT SUM(odli.Quantity * odli.UnitPrice)

			) AS InvoicesTotalValue
	
	
	FROM Sales.Customers as cu

) as Z

ORDER BY AbsoluteValueDifference DESC, TotalNBOrders ASC, CustomerID ASC


-- CONCLUSION : it's consistent !

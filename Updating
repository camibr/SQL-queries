-------- QUERY 2

/*
For the CustomerId = 1060 (CustomerName = 'Anand Mudaliyar')
Identify the first InvoiceLine of his first Invoice, where "first" means the lowest respective IDs, 
and write an update query increasing the UnitPrice of this InvoiceLine by 20.
*/

-- STRATEGY -> UPDATE and TOP


UPDATE Sales.InvoiceLines
SET UnitPrice = UnitPrice + 20
WHERE InvoiceLineID =
(
	SELECT TOP 1 
		--cu.CustomerName,
		ivli.InvoiceLineID 
		--ivli.*
	FROM Sales.Customers as cu
		, Sales.InvoiceLines as ivli
		, Sales.Invoices as iv
	WHERE cu.CustomerID = iv.CustomerID
		AND iv.InvoiceID = ivli.InvoiceID
		AND cu.CustomerID = 1060
		ORDER BY ivli.InvoiceID ASC, ivli.InvoiceLineID ASC
);


--test

	SELECT ivli.*
	FROM Sales.Customers as cu
		, Sales.InvoiceLines as ivli
		, Sales.Invoices as iv
	WHERE cu.CustomerID = iv.CustomerID
		AND iv.InvoiceID = ivli.InvoiceID
		AND cu.CustomerID = 1060


-- And when we re-run the first query, we see that the update has been performed correctly
